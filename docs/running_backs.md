# Running Back Statistics
The running back is the most physical "skill" position on the offensive side of the football.  Running backs are either blocking during a passing play, often times against a linbacker or defensive lineman who outweigh them by at least 50 lbs, or running the ball in the A or B gap and getting tackled by those same linebackers and defensive lineman.  

From a scoring perspective, running backs can be hit or miss, depending on the team's philosophy regarding their offensive playbook.  This typically breaks down to if a team is a "primary run" team or a "primary pass" team.  Teams such as the Green Bay Packers and the New Orleans Saints are "primary pass" teams, whereas the Buffalo Bills and the Dallas Cowboys are "primary run" teams.  While these stats are based on % of plays of each type, they can be informative in determining how many opportunities a running back may have per game to get points. 

Other factors and statistics to consider will be discussed below.

## Population Statistics
As with other positions, we will consider the running backs population statistics as a part of determining which factors will be used in the model.  Statistics we will examine are:
- total rushing yards
- total rushing touchdowns
- total receiving yards
- total receiving touchdowns
